# MY *HASKELL* CORNER

## Brief *Prelude*
Every person has heard at least once about programming languages like *C* (or *C++*), *BASIC*, *Java*... They are present in almost every application. But _**Haskell**_, who knows it? It's a pity, but only a few people know about it. 

- As a **Mathematics** student, *Haskell* will help you understand the way they are built. In addition, it's the perfect tool for **proving properties** and defining functions to solve mathematical problems.

- And as a **Physics** student, this programming language will give you the chance to define applications which are very simmilar to mathematical expressions, so the way they are defined is very easy. **Evaluating an expression** will no longer be a difficult task.

However, in spite of all the advantages mentioned above, it's very enjoyable to write programs in *Haskell* language. Defining new types and data constructors will **rise your horizones**. Card games, trees, etc., everything you can imagine be written in *Haskell*.

## Aim of the project
The main aim of my repository is to share with all the Internet community my achievements in my 'learning race' across *Haskell*.
